Explain:
--------
Coal Generator:
This generator will generate energy if he is burning coal/charcoal

Wire:
The wire will transport electricity

Battery Charger:
A battery charger will charge a battery so you can have electricity with you ( maybe for tools ? )

Battery Uncharger:
A battery uncharger will uncharge a battery so you can do stuff with the electricity

Enttery:
This battery will can be linked to an other enttery

Solar Panel:
A solar panel will generate electricity by the sun
How higher the sun is how more electricity it makes

Water Generator:
The water generator will generate electricity if he is next to a flowing water ( if possible to program )
and the water generator must face to the water next to the block

PLC:
With a PLC you can do logic gates

Switch:
A switch will turn a circuit of wires on/off

Lamp:
A lamp will give light if he gets energy
